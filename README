At times, it would be nice to have Java a class to represent the ISO 639-3 code of a text.

Unfortunately, Java imposes limitations on method size that can potentially make implementing such a class problematic.

This code is a workaround for those limitations.



First, download http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/iso-639-3_20120206.tab and place the file iso-639-3_20120206.tab in this directory.

Then, type make.

That will build a jar that you can use.
